# RAG Chatbot using Llama 2, Pinecone, and LangChain

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot built using **LangChain**, **Meta Llama 2**, and **Pinecone** for semantic document retrieval and context-aware question answering.

This project demonstrates how to build a **document-based AI assistant** that retrieves relevant information from a knowledge source and generates grounded responses using a large language model.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project implements a **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** pipeline where:

- source documents are processed and embedded
- embeddings are stored in **Pinecone**
- relevant chunks are retrieved based on user queries
- retrieved context is passed to **Llama 2**
- the chatbot generates context-aware responses

This architecture is commonly used in **enterprise AI assistants**, **document Q&A systems**, and **knowledge retrieval applications**.

##⚙️ Installation & Setup
1️⃣ Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/Nikith2611/RAG-based-chatbot-using-Llama2-Pinecone-and-langchain.git
cd RAG-based-chatbot-using-Llama2-Pinecone-and-langchain
##2️⃣ Create and Activate a Conda Environment
conda create -n mchatbot python=3.8 -y
conda activate mchatbot
##3️⃣ Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
---
##🔐 Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the project root and add your Pinecone credentials:

PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key
PINECONE_API_ENV=your_pinecone_environment

⚠️ Make sure your .env file is not committed to GitHub.

##🧠 Model Setup
Download the Llama 2 Model

Download the following model file:

llama-2-7b-chat.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin
Model Source

Download it from Hugging Face:

TheBloke / Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGML

Place the downloaded model file in the location expected by your application.

📚 Data Source

This project uses the following knowledge source:

Medical_book.pdf

The PDF is processed, chunked, embedded, and indexed into Pinecone to enable document-based question answering.

📦 Indexing the Documents

Run the indexing script to process the document and store embeddings in Pinecone:

python store_index.py

This step performs the following:

loads the PDF document
splits the content into chunks
generates embeddings
stores the embeddings in Pinecone for retrieval

Make sure your Pinecone index is configured properly before running this step.

▶️ Run the Application

Start the Flask application:

python app.py

Then open your browser and visit:

http://localhost:5000
💬 How It Works
The user asks a question in the chatbot interface
The query is converted into embeddings
Pinecone retrieves the most relevant document chunks
Retrieved context is passed to Llama 2
The model generates a grounded response based on the retrieved content

This improves response quality by reducing hallucinations and increasing factual relevance.
